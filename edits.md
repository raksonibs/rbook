- First round of edits:
  - Focused on general grammar and content changes, as some information is too inadequate to get a good picture of react (ie: the pros vs cons doesn't amplify the paper)
- Second
  - did a general formatting edit to properly include sources, and make it appear more bookish
  - updated the graphs and format (footnotes, justified margins)
  - smaller grammar edits and some content changes to ending and beginning
- Third
  - formatting to follow structure of a technical report more closely via headers
  - added appendcies, references, and sections according to technical report
